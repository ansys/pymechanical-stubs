Mechanical API Documentation
============================

The following documentation examines the APIs used in Ansys Mechanical. It provides descriptions
of the objects, methods, and properties for all namespaces used in the application.

Additional documentation includes the `Scripting in Mechanical Guide <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v241/en/act_script/act_script.html>`_
as well as the `ACT API Reference Guide <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v241/en/act_ref/act_ref.html>`_.
The scripting guide contains similar information as the reference guide but provides practical examples of how you use
the APIs in Mechanical. Whereas, the reference guide offers a complete listing of all supported APIs.
This documentation serves as a subset of the reference guide offering a focused listing of all supported APIs for Mechanical:

- `API reference <api/index.html>`_

This documentation can also be found on the `Ansys Developer Portal <https://developer.ansys.com/docs/mechanical-api-documentation/api/index.md>`_.
